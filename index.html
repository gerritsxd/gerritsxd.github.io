      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Gerrit, I am Spanish and Dutch. I speak Spanish and English as my mother tongues, then I can also communicate in Dutch, French and Portuguese. I have studied in Spain, in California, and in the Netherlands. I graduated high school in California at age 17, but decided to enroll in the IB, which because of the pandemic I was not able to complete every subject, nevertheless that same year I graduated high school with the American diploma and the Spanish one. I have always liked computers and have accumulated a lot of knowledge that ranges from Windows OS to Linux. I have also developed some projects of my own, further accumulating more knowledge regarding PWA development with databases and API integrations, and I have developed a deep interest in the cybersecurity field.</p>
